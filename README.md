# 2048-GAME

The program support the following functionality:
1. Move left, right, up, and down operations using (a,w,s,d)
2. Restart (New Game) (r) or Quit (q) the current Game options. 
4. Initial board contains 2 random number (2 or 4) placed at any two random positions (If we restart the
game, the position should vary)
5. Once the game begins, a new random number (2 or 4) need to be added for every valid move. If that can’t be
done, the game is over
6. When generating a random number, the probability of 2 and 4 is 0.8 and 0.2 respectively.
7. If a move does not change the position of any of the pieces, it’s not a valid move. So, will not be added any new
piece
8. There is a counter of how many valid moves are being made. At the end of the game,  the number of valid moves made will be printed.
